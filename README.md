🛒 E-Commerce Customer Segmentation & Prediction
This project applies data science and machine learning to analyze customer purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
It segments customers into meaningful groups and predicts future customer categories, enabling targeted marketing, churn reduction, and improved retention strategies.
The project also includes an interactive Gradio web app with PWA support (in progress) for real-time predictions.
